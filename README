This respository contains the ns-2.35 code for endhost data center controllers. It is built by extending ns-2.35 by adding support for endhost controllers. 

Each endhost at the data center runs an openflow style controller that reads network statistics from the switches by polling them at short (RTT) time scales. 

For overhead reduction, there are schemes for statistics sharing. Currently, there are per-rack sharing, per-pod sharing and per-pod bottom up sharing. 

Master branch has the code for per-rack sharing and there is a seperate branch for each of the other sharing schemes. 

To run this code, clone this repository into your /ns-allinone-2.35/ns-2.35 directory and replace all the files in their by the files in this repository. 

Then use FatGraphGenerator.py to generate a FatTree with k value of your choice. This will produce files out.txt,  mapping.txt and out.tcl. place out.txt, and

mapping.txt in the /ns-allinone-2.35/ns-2.35/common/ directory. These files contain topology information and mappings for info sharing DHT and are read

from node.cc file. 

run out.tcl from ns to get the experiment going.
